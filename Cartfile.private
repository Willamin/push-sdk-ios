# Quick 1.1.0 (the currnently released verison) has an issue building when
# Swiftlint is installed (see: https://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/694). We're
# pulling forward to the commit that fixes this issue, until Quick releases a
# new version and we can remove this very specific version pinning.
